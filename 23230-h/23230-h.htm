3</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The following papers were written at the request of one who
had read the somewhat similar papers addressed to girls.&nbsp;
The object aimed at in both books has been to try and help Boys
and Girls of the so-called working classes to recognize their
duties to God and their neighbour, and to use on the side of
right the powers and opportunities which God has given them.</p>
<p>It seems to the author that advice given to the so-called
lower orders, often partakes too much of patronage, and too
little of the brotherhood, that should be a sign of
Christians.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do as you are told and be
thankful,&rdquo; is too much the tone of the advice, instead of
explaining duties, pointing out opportunities, and recognizing
them as fellow-labourers in the great work.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s household everyone has his place assigned to
him by the master, some to govern, and some to serve, but still
all are fellow-servants of that one Master, and brethren in
Christ.</p>
<h2><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>BOYS.</h2>
<p>What a curious fellow a boy is.&nbsp; I wonder if boys ever
think about themselves.&nbsp; A young monkey is full of mischief,
a young puppy is full of play, a young kitten is always ready for
fun, but a boy seems to combine the qualities of all three, and
to have a stock of his own to jumble up with them.&nbsp; A boy
has so many sides, not only an outside and an inside; he is a
many sided being.&nbsp; See him at one time and you would hardly
suppose him to be the same creature that you had seen a little
while before.&nbsp; Now he is a bright nice spoken lad, in a few
moments he is a bullying tyrant, now he is courteously answering
those who speak to him, now words come from his lips that shock
the hearer.&nbsp; Now he would scorn to have his word doubted by
a comrade, now he does not hesitate to lie to escape
punishment.&nbsp; Now fearless, now a coward, now full of
spirits, now in the depths of woe&mdash;sunshine or joy, wind and
calm, silence and tumult, all seem to have their place, and to
make up that incomprehensible and yet delightful animal a
boy.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Now boys, I want you to think of yourselves&mdash;not to
think how good or how bad you are&mdash;what fine fellows you
are, and what important persons, but what you are capable of
becoming.&nbsp; You will not remain boys always&mdash;you are
now, in the midst of all your oddities, forming your character,
and shaping your future course, drawing out of the midst of all
your contradictions the character that will make you honest
God-fearing men, like in your degree to the perfect pattern of
manhood which God has set before us in Christ&mdash;or you are
letting yourselves be moulded into the selfish sensual being,
which too often degrades the name of man.</p>
<p>Thinking, I know, is not much in your line at present, but you
will perhaps spare me a few minutes, and give me a little of your
attention while I try to point out to you the way in which you
may, if you will, turn your powers to account, and avoid the
dangers which have been the shipwreck of many a lad&rsquo;s
bright prospects.</p>
<h2><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>HOME AND SCHOOL</h2>
<p>I shall take it for granted that you care for your parents and
home, or at any rate that you would like to have a comfortable
home.&nbsp; Well, then, make it so yourself.&nbsp; You can do a
great deal towards it.&nbsp; Honour and obedience is your first
duty towards your parents.&nbsp; There is nothing manly in
disobedience.&nbsp; Honour and obey, readily and
cheerfully.&nbsp; Not simply obedient to father because he might
thrash you; and disobedient to mother because she cannot compel
you.&nbsp; No, the truest honour in a boy is when mother can
thoroughly trust him&mdash;trust him to obey her because she is
mother.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters are often a trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
those children do nag?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never can leave those
boys together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure to teaze her
if I leave them alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be a bully either
to your brothers or sisters.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be selfish and
claim all you can for yourself.&nbsp; Share and share alike
should be the rule, and gentleness towards the girls and little
ones.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>School will help to take the nonsense out of you; you
cannot have it all your own way there.&nbsp; Boys will be boys,
is a very common expression, and it would be very funny indeed if
boys did not turn out to be boys, but that is no reason that boys
should be rude or cruel, and in fact &ldquo;little
cubs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quarrels there will be sometimes&mdash;very
often for no real reason, sometimes for a good cause.&nbsp; If
you have one fight it out then and there, and bear no malice
afterwards.&nbsp; I would rather see a fair fight and have done
with it, than keeping up a nasty quarrel, and trying to spite one
another in little mean ways.&nbsp; There is too often a want of
real honour amongst boys.&nbsp; Telling tales of one another
seems to be the fashion, and the favourite way of paying off old
scores.&nbsp; There are of course times when a boy must speak out
against wrong, even at the risk of being counted a sneak, but, as
a rule, boys who delight in telling tales, and who have not the
sense of honour to stick by one another are a very poor lot.</p>
<p>Do your school work thoroughly.&nbsp; Idleness is not only
wrong but foolish.&nbsp; There is a time for work and a time for
play.&nbsp; Learn as much as you can and learn thoroughly if you
want to be of any <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>use in after life.&nbsp; A boy&rsquo;s
religion is not a thing that shows very much on the surface, or
that he is very likely to talk much about, but it must be in him
if he is any worth.</p>
<p>Boys and girls alike should learn from their mother to say
their prayers night and morning, and when they become too old, or
mother too busy for them to say them at her knee, they should
never omit to say them by themselves.&nbsp; I heard the other day
of a rough labouring man, who on his death bed sent for the
priest of his parish.&nbsp; He said he had never been inside a
Church since he had been a man.&nbsp; He had done his work
honestly, and lived steadily, but had altogether got out of the
way of going to Church.&nbsp; There was one thing, however, that
he had always done.&nbsp; Long years ago, as a lad, he had
promised his mother never to get up in the morning or go to bed
at night without saying his prayers.&nbsp; This promise he had
kept faithfully.&nbsp; Night and morning that rough strong man
had knelt and said the same prayers which he had first learnt at
his mother&rsquo;s knees.&nbsp; Those prayers had been heard and
had brought their blessing to him.&nbsp; Church going on Sunday
is as important as daily prayers.&nbsp; A Sunday morning <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>should never be allowed to pass without seeing you at
Church.&nbsp; Lie a bed on Sunday morning is the devil&rsquo;s
version of the fourth commandment.&nbsp; There is plenty of time
on Sunday for Church as well as for walks and talks.&nbsp; Sunday
is not to be a miserable day, or all Church and prayers, but God
first and then ourselves.&nbsp; Sunday school you will most
likely be sent to as long as you go to day school, and you will
be wise not to give it up as soon as you are what you would call
your own master.</p>
<p>Both home and school ought to have their pleasures as well as
their work.&nbsp; Do your work thoroughly, and do your pleasures
thoroughly also.&nbsp; Share your pleasures with the others, and
with father and mother.&nbsp; You can give much pleasure to
father and mother, as well as to yourselves, if you try.</p>
<p>Love God and love your home&mdash;be obedient, truthful, and
plucky&mdash;standing up for the right, and not ashamed to refuse
to join in the wrong; and your home and school days will train
you well for your work in life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>GOING TO WORK</h2>
<p>What are you going to be? is a question that has to be settled
very early in life&mdash;earlier amongst the so-called working
classes than any other.&nbsp; It must be settled at about
thirteen years old.&nbsp; Fortunately for you it is not whether
you shall do anything for your living or not, but in what way you
shall earn your living.&nbsp; Some people seem to look upon work
as if it were a degrading thing, and only to be used until they
can afford to live without it.&nbsp; Life is not worth calling
life that is not downright honest work, and a man is hardly a man
at all who is not a working man&mdash;working either with his
hands or his brain, or both.</p>
<p>In determining what your calling in life shall be you must
consider two things, 1st.&nbsp; Whether the calling you wish to
follow is an honest and lawful one. 2nd.&nbsp; Whether you are
fitted for it.</p>
<p>If you can say yes to both these questions, then, provided
your parents approve, follow out your natural inclination.&nbsp;
A lad is far more likely to succeed in life if his heart is in
his work, than if he <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>has to work against the grain.&nbsp;
On the other hand, you will never deserve success if you go
against your parents&rsquo; wishes.&nbsp; If they see reasons
against the particular calling you wish for, (and perhaps are
really fitted for), your duty is to follow their wishes, and bide
your time.&nbsp; If your inclinations really point to that to
which God calls you, He will show you the right way to it in His
time, and your obedience to your parents will not have been
wasted time.</p>
<p>There are certain occupations which are not honourable, but by
which men gain a living, which are not to be considered for a
moment, as <i>e.g.</i>, gambling and betting.&nbsp; There are
certain for which you would not be fitted by education or
ability.&nbsp; Whatever calling you choose seek God and His
righteousness first, <i>i.e.</i>, choose that which will make you
fit for the next world as well as that which will make you
comfortable here.&nbsp; Honest work thoroughly done here will be
no bad passport for another world.&nbsp; When you have once
chosen your calling stick to it, carry it out thoroughly, and
with a determination to get on.&nbsp; Never be in a hurry to
change, and never do so without a good reason.&nbsp; Never rest
satisfied that you have done enough, or <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>think that
you cannot do better.&nbsp; It is told of a celebrated sculptor,
that he said, &ldquo;I shall fail in my next effort, for I am
satisfied with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aim high and do your best.&nbsp; Every shop-boy may not become
a Lord Mayor, but every one who aims at getting to the top of the
tree, and goes steadily at it, will find himself at last a good
way from the ground.</p>
<p>Now supposing you have made your choice and started in work
you will find a great difference between this and school
life.&nbsp; You will mix with elder people and a different set;
you will have more freedom, and possibly a little more money.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think you are a man all at once, because you are
nothing of the sort, and nothing makes a lad look more ridiculous
than to see him trying to be a man before his time.&nbsp; You
know the story of the toad and the ox.</p>
<p>You have much to learn yet.&nbsp; Stick to classes and learn
all that you can.&nbsp; Sunday classes as well as night
classes.&nbsp; There is nothing manly in giving up religious
duties; quite the contrary, it is cowardly.&nbsp; Do your work
honestly and thoroughly, even though it be the custom to do
otherwise.&nbsp; Boys are pretty sure to have some hobby of their
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>own, and a very good thing too.&nbsp; A boy is all the
better for a hobby, even if he takes it up and drops it
again.&nbsp; It is a good thing for a lad to have some private
interest of his own.&nbsp; If therefore your hobby is not
anything harmful follow it out with a will.</p>
<h2><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>RELIGION.</h2>
<p>I had some doubts about the heading of this chapter: Religion
ought not to be a separate thing from daily life, and, therefore,
all remarks on the subject ought to come under one or other of
the chapters which treat of the different duties of life.&nbsp;
There are, however, certain definite religious duties which may
perhaps be spoken of more clearly in a separate chapter.&nbsp; I
would ask you always to bear in mind that no religious duties are
of much value that are not a regular part of our daily life, and
that there is no line to be drawn between natural and religious
duties.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether, therefore, ye eat or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Prayer</i>, private and public.&nbsp; What I have said in a
former paper holds good now.&nbsp; No boy can safely neglect his
morning and evening prayers and his public worship on
Sundays.&nbsp; Prayer should include daily self-examination: no
one can get on in the world unless he looks after his own
affairs, and reckons from time to time how he stands.&nbsp; So
with our daily life&mdash;we should try it day by day, <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and
see if we are keeping straight.&nbsp; Each night we should look
back over the day, see what has been wrong, what
imperfect&mdash;seek pardon for the wrong, and determine, by
God&rsquo;s help, to amend it.</p>
<p><i>Public Worship</i> once a Sunday, <i>i.e.</i> in the
morning, is the duty of every Christian: whether we go oftener is
a matter of choice, but less we cannot do without failing in our
duty.&nbsp; Attendance at the full morning service, <i>i.e.</i>
the celebration of the Holy Communion, is the prayer-book rule,
whether we observe it or not.</p>
<p><i>Regular Communion</i> is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; How
frequently it is advisable to come must depend upon
circumstances, but speaking generally I should say, in the words
of one whose opinion carries great weight, that &ldquo;monthly
Communions are the very fewest which anyone seeking to serve God
devoutly can make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have taken it for granted that you have been confirmed,
which will probably have taken place about the time of leaving
school.&nbsp; Confirmation ought to make a marked change in your
life.&nbsp; Firstly, because you are more directly responsible
for yourself, and, secondly, because it brings you into closer
relation, for a time at least, with your <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>clergyman.&nbsp; Before your first communion the prayer
book speaks to you very distinctly about personal advice and
intercourse with your parish priest.&nbsp; Neither your first or
any subsequent communions are to be made unless you are satisfied
as to your own fitness to come to it.&nbsp; If you are in doubt
you are advised to go to God&rsquo;s minister, lay before him
those sins that make you afraid or doubtful of coming, and seek
his advice.&nbsp; This is not pleasant, but it is useful.&nbsp;
Many people speak against it, but it is Christ&rsquo;s appointed
way.&nbsp; If you feel that this will help you, go as often as
you need, and do not be stopped by any foolish remarks of people
who do not understand it, or by any thought of its being a weak
and unmanly thing to do.&nbsp; It requires courage, perseverance,
and a true estimate of oneself to do it, and these are not
generally considered unmanly qualities.&nbsp; Some of the best
men, some of the bravest soldiers, have not been ashamed of using
this means of grace.&nbsp; Knights of old were accustomed to
confess before they went into battle.&nbsp; Read the life of
Henry V. of England.&nbsp; He was no milksop, or, as people would
say now-a-days, priest-ridden king, but he did not look upon it
as an unmanly thing.&nbsp; You are free <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>to choose, or
free to refuse it; only pray to be guided aright by God&rsquo;s
Holy Spirit to do that which shall be most to His glory and your
soul&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p><i>Almsgiving</i>.&nbsp; Whatever money you have of your own
some portion&mdash;a tenth, if possible,&mdash;should be given to
God in some way or other.</p>
<p><i>Bringing others to God</i>.&nbsp; We must not be selfish in
our religion&mdash;if God has made known the truth to us we must
do our best that others may share it also.&nbsp; You can do much
in a quiet way, not only by example: you can get a word in where
others have not a chance.&nbsp; Many a youngster would gladly
keep from wrong, and go on steadily, if he had only someone to
stand by him.&nbsp; It is not enough to be good, we must do good,
and never laugh at another for his religion.&nbsp; Many years ago
a thorough change was worked in a school by the courage of one
little boy.&nbsp; He came fresh from home, where he had been
accustomed to say his prayers.&nbsp; He knelt down in a school
dormitory, as he had been used to do at home, by his
bedside.&nbsp; There was a sudden silence, the boys were
astonished.&nbsp; Then some began to bully and try and stop him;
others stood up for him.&nbsp; But the battle was won.&nbsp; The
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>better minded boys saw what cowards they had been to
give up what they knew was right for fear of chaff&mdash;one by
one they gradually followed his example, and before that lad left
school it was the rule and not the exception for the boys to say
their prayers.</p>
<p><i>Fasting</i>.&nbsp; People understand feasts and are ready
enough to keep them, but fasting is quite another matter.&nbsp;
Feasts should be kept, and the more the great festivals are
recognized the better.&nbsp; Fasting, however, is quite as
necessary.&nbsp; Appointed times in which to remember more
particularly Christ&rsquo;s suffering for us, to deny ourselves
lawful pleasures, and to make us think more of our sins and how
to conquer them.&nbsp; They keep us from getting careless, and
letting our religion become a sort of Sunday clothes, to be put
on at certain times, but to have no real effect upon our daily
life.</p>
<p>One thing more.&nbsp; God has given you brains and the power
to use them.&nbsp; You are bound then to try and learn about God,
and the duty you owe to Him.&nbsp; Every year you ought to
advance in knowledge, and not be content with the little you were
taught as a child.&nbsp; Read your Bible&mdash;think it out for
yourself&mdash;pray for understanding, and study such books as
will help you to a better knowledge of it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>COURAGE.</h2>
<p>Boys and men are great cowards.&nbsp; There is hardly any
accusation that an Englishman or boy resents so much as to be
called a coward.&nbsp; Still I venture to make the accusation,
and will try and make good my words.&nbsp; I do not mean that you
are cowards in the sense of being afraid to attempt any act of
daring.&nbsp; You have pluck enough to tackle a fellow half as
big again as yourself, pluck enough to endure pain without a
word, pluck enough to risk your life to save another, but too
often you have not pluck enough to say no, or to brave a
laugh.&nbsp; That is what I mean by saying that men and boys are
cowards.&nbsp; You will let the worst fellow of the lot be the
leader and give the tone to conversation because you have not the
pluck to say boldly that it is wrong, and that you will not join
in it.&nbsp; This want of moral courage makes a lad give up
little by little his hold on what is right.&nbsp; Sunday school,
Church-going, prayers given up because Jem chaffs so about
them.&nbsp; If he chooses to neglect them that is his look
out.&nbsp; You have as much right to your <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>opinion as he
has to his.&nbsp; Why should you let him show more courage in
doing wrong than you in doing right.&nbsp; Are you afraid of
him?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Well then, stick to your duty.</p>
<p>I said just now that going to work throws you in with a
different set of companions.&nbsp; Here, specially, comes the
test of your courage.&nbsp; Are you going to follow bad leaders,
or have you the courage of your own opinions.&nbsp; There is one
particular subject where courage is most needed, and where it
most often fails.&nbsp; A young lad naturally wants to seem to be
manly&mdash;has a sort of feeling that he would like to show that
he is not just a little boy and bound to do as he is told.&nbsp;
He is tempted to show his manliness by neglect of home commands,
rough and rude manners, bad language and bad talk.&nbsp; I have
remarked before how home obedience and true manliness go
together; here I want to speak more particularly about bad
language and bad talking, and the evil it leads to.&nbsp; S. Paul
speaks about it very plainly when he says, speaking of the things
that should not be named amongst Christians, &ldquo;neither
filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting, which are not
convenient.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, boys, all indecent words and
conversations are <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>wrong&mdash;they are sinful, unmanly,
degrading.&nbsp; I know you cannot help hearing much that is
wrong.&nbsp; Shame, be it said, to the men of England&mdash;yes,
men who talk of advancement and freedom, men who are fathers of
families, that they too often make or allow the talk of the
workshop to be such that no boy can work there without hearing
words and jokes which are not fit, I do not say for Christians to
hear, but not fit to be spoken.&nbsp; Hearing words of evil you
often cannot help.&nbsp; To join in them you can and must refuse,
and unless you do so refuse you are a coward and false to your
profession.&nbsp; I do not speak here of actual deeds of
sin&mdash;no one can do or join in an impure deed without knowing
that he is sinning, but many think that there is no great harm in
listening to and laughing at what others say.&nbsp; Be warned in
time, it is but a very little step from laughing at to joining in
bad conversation, and a very small step from words to
action.&nbsp; The same want of courage that joins in the laugh
will make it difficult to say no when tempted further.&nbsp;
Never, with companions of your own sex, and still more with those
of the opposite sex, let any corrupt communications proceed out
of your mouth.&nbsp; If it is necessary for you to speak upon
such subjects <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>ask advice of those older than
yourself, and not of companions of your own age.&nbsp; You know
lads that you love your mother and care for your sisters.&nbsp;
You would be furious if anyone spoke to or of them as you
sometimes hear women spoken of.&nbsp; What would be an insult to
them is an insult to any woman.&nbsp; Stand up for the honour and
respect due to others as you would for your own mother or
sister.&nbsp; You would not talk like that before your
mother.&nbsp; Make it a rule never to do or say anything that you
would be ashamed to say in her presence, or in the presence of
anyone you respect.&nbsp; Courage is what you want here and
plenty of it, but if you will only make a stand for the right,
strength, not your own, will be given you.&nbsp; I can tell you
of one who did so try and do the same.&nbsp; Bishop Pattison, who
died some years ago, when he was fearlessly doing his duty in the
islands of the Pacific, was, once a boy, face to face with this
difficulty.&nbsp; He was in the cricket eleven of his
school&mdash;a good player and very fond of the game.&nbsp; It
had become the custom at cricket suppers for bad talk to be
indulged in.&nbsp; Pattison one evening rose up at the table and
said, &ldquo;If this conversation is to be allowed I must leave
the eleven.&nbsp; I cannot <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>share in this
conversation&mdash;if you determine to continue it I shall have

25</span>MONEY.</h2>
<p>The love of money is the root of all evil.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
money in a civilized country is a necessity.&nbsp; How to make it
is one of the great questions, and how to spend it aright is one
of the great difficulties.</p>
<p>Money is power.&nbsp; It is power, if we use it aright, it
overpowers us if we use it badly or even carelessly.&nbsp; It is
a great mistake to want to make your money too quickly, and a
still greater mistake to think that you are likely to do
so.&nbsp; Money that is the result of honest labour will, if
rightly used, be a blessing to you and yours.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; How to make it.&nbsp; By honest labour, honestly
done.&nbsp; You have chosen your trade or occupation&mdash;let
your money be honestly earned therein, and look more to the
quality of your work than to the quantity of your money.&nbsp;
You have a right when you have learnt your trade to a fair
day&rsquo;s wage for a fair day&rsquo;s work, but be sure that
the word fair governs both the work and the wage&mdash;the fair
work must be done before the fair wage can be rightly
claimed.&nbsp; There is far too much scamping <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>work in the
present day, working simply for money and not for any interest in
the work itself.&nbsp; Money should not be a man&rsquo;s test of
success, but the perfectness of his work.&nbsp; Men used once to
work for love of their art, and so long as the picture was
painted or the sculpture wrought, they cared little for the money
they were to gain by it, or the hardship of their lives, but now
men paint for what the public will pay for, and write and work
not from their hearts but for their pockets.&nbsp; And with high
and low, not success but money is the moving power&mdash;not how
can I can make it more perfect, but what can I get for it.&nbsp;
A man who will leave a piece of work, or a clerk who will leave a
few minutes writing only because the clock has struck the hour,
is little better than a money-making machine.&nbsp; Work done in
such a spirit did not give us men like Wren or Stephenson.&nbsp;
Read their lives and you will see what I mean.&nbsp; If your work
is thoroughly and honestly done, you have a right to your own
price for it, if you can find a purchaser.&nbsp; You have a right
to sell your labour at your own price, but the master has an
equal right to buy or to refuse.&nbsp; Combinations and unions of
working men are perfectly right, if they unite for their own <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>advantage, and for protection against oppression, and
strikes may, though in very rare cases, be a painful
necessity.&nbsp; It must be borne in mind that there can be no
fixed standard of wages.&nbsp; Wages must vary with the state of
the markets.&nbsp; Men must be ready to accept lower wages when
trade is dull, they must bear their share of the depression as
well as the masters, and the true principle is for men and
masters, or if you like the expression better, capital and labour
to go hand in hand.&nbsp; The success or ruin of the one is the
success or ruin of the other.&nbsp; There are of course cases of
grasping masters who will endeavour to grind their workmen, and
there are cases of worthless and obstinate workmen, who look only
to themselves and the present moment, but both ought to be and
might be very rare exceptions, if the good and true men on both
sides would come to the front.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; How to spend the money.&nbsp; Remember that you are
God&rsquo;s steward, and will have to account for the use of this
bounty.&nbsp; Give your tithe to God first.&nbsp; The tenth part
of your profits, whether reckoned weekly or yearly, should be
given to God in some way or other, and those who do it will find
themselves blessed in earthly things, whilst they are <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>laying up a treasure in heaven.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s tithe
paid, how is the rest of your income to be spent? 1st.&nbsp;
Necessary expenses, <i>i.e.</i>, food, clothing, &amp;c.
2nd.&nbsp; Useful expenditure, <i>i.e.</i>, learning, books,
&amp;c. 3rd.&nbsp; Recreation and minor luxuries.</p>
<p>Pay your way as you go, and never run into debt.&nbsp; Debt is
next door neighbour to theft.&nbsp; Two things I would impress
upon you, first, that where the need is you should repay your
parents care by helping them.&nbsp; England is disgraced by the
number of old people who are left to the care of the parish by
children who ought to be thankful to be allowed to support
them.&nbsp; Secondly, that it is your duty to make provision for
the future, so that the workhouse may not even enter into your
calculations, as a possible refuge in old age for you and
yours.&nbsp; This can be done by regular savings, even though
very small, and by insuring your life.&nbsp; Post office and
other savings&rsquo; banks, will help you in the former, and
various insurance offices offer special facilities by weekly and
monthly payments for the latter.</p>
<h2><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>AMUSEMENTS.</h2>
<p>Recreation is as necessary as work.&nbsp; What kind is to be
sought after, and what avoided?&nbsp; For health&rsquo;s sake, if
for nothing else, boys should have some kind of out-door
amusements.&nbsp; A boy has an easy choice of good and healthy
recreation, and therefore has no excuse for taking up with bad
objects.&nbsp; Cricket, Rowing, Volunteering, and such-like, are
healthy, and easily obtainable recreations.&nbsp; Gambling,
drinking, loitering, are not to be thought of for a moment, they
are the curse of the lazy and weak-minded.&nbsp; Theatres are
very good if you keep out of the cheap and nasty ones.&nbsp;
Music halls are much better avoided.&nbsp; I do not say that it
is necessarily wrong to go there, or that you are certain to come
to harm if you frequent them, but there is more chance of
temptation, and an inferior entertainment for your money.&nbsp;
Well acted plays may open out your mind, but the silliness of the
music hall entertainment will only react upon you.&nbsp; You can
tell a music hall frequenter, not by the words of his mouth so
much as by the shuffle of his feet: his highest <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>ambition
seems to be to dance the double shuffle, and perhaps sing a few
verses of some jingling rhyme.&nbsp; Out-door recreation is not
so easily attainable, in the winter, as the time at your disposal
is so short.&nbsp; In-door amusements must, to a great extent,
take their place.&nbsp; The gymnasium is a good institution;
chess is a game worth learning, and very fascinating to some
minds; cards are good as long as gambling is avoided, and many
other games readily suggest themselves to one&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Reading will be more to the liking of many.&nbsp; Read books
which are worth reading, not the penny trash which shops offer to
the boys of England.&nbsp; I should hope that the boys of England
have sufficient brains to care for something a little above the
penny dreadfuls, otherwise it is a bad look out for the future
men of England.&nbsp; Independently of libraries you can now get
books, by good writers, as cheap as sixpence&mdash;Walter Scott,
Fennimore Cooper, Maryatt, Dickens, &amp;c.&nbsp; A word about
books.&nbsp; Of course, in books by writers such as I have
mentioned you will find many things spoken of which are wrong and
ought not to be.&nbsp; They must write so if stories are to be
written of life as we find it, and mere goody-goody books, which
avoid all mention <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of such things, are unnatural, and do
not give true pictures of life.&nbsp; The harm of too many cheap
publications, and not only the cheap ones, is, that in speaking
of these things they make them appear unavoidable, and even
worthy of praise.&nbsp; Good writers show how revolting crime and
evil is, how they can be overcome and resisted, and how truth and
honesty must prevail in the end.&nbsp; The difference between
good books and plays and bad ones is not so much the subjects
they write about as the way in which they speak of them.&nbsp;
Some of the cheap literature is only foolish, some is distinctly
wicked, but both are better avoided, and your time and money
spent on worthier objects.&nbsp; Avoid bad company, and take care
that your recreations are manly and honest.</p>
<h2><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>HOME DUTIES.</h2>
<p>As soon as you begin to bear your share in the expenses of
home, you will naturally look to have your word in the
arrangements thereof.&nbsp; From the time that you begin to earn
your own living, until the time that you make a home for
yourself, there will be certain home duties which you have no
right to neglect.</p>
<p>First of all, you must be ready to bear your fair share in the
expenses of the home.&nbsp; When first you go to work, you will
probably be expected to bring home all your money, and have a
certain sum given to you for pocket money.&nbsp; As you grow
older, you will agree to pay a certain sum for your board and
lodging, and keep the rest for yourself.&nbsp; Let your payments
be such as will do a little more than actually cover the expense
of what you have.&nbsp; Give a thought to the general comfort of
the home, and in time of need when perhaps your father&rsquo;s
work is slack, be ready to increase your help, even though it may
decrease your own personal comfort.</p>
<p>Secondly, you must acknowledge the authority <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of the head
of the house, and respect his wishes as to home arrangements,
time for being in at night, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thirdly.&nbsp; Recognise your responsibilities to your
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; If you are the eldest son you are
bound to be the example, and if need be the protector of the
others, and whether elder or not you have still your duties and
responsibilities.&nbsp; A good brother is a great help to a
sister, and her brother&rsquo;s good opinion will be something
which she will be very sorry to forfeit through any fault of
hers.&nbsp; For your sisters&rsquo; sake specially you are bound
to be careful that your companions whom you may bring home with
you should not be such as would not be fit company for
them.&nbsp; Your duties to your parents I have already mentioned,
and the older you grow the more thoroughly you should carry them
out, so that, as you grow out of mere boyhood, you may become
more and more the companion and friend of your father, and more
and more the comfort and support of your mother.&nbsp; It is a
great thing in time of trouble to have one son to whom they can
look without fear of his help failing them.&nbsp; It is far too
common to see young fellows, so soon as they can earn enough <!--
page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>to support themselves, leaving home and going into
lodgings because they are freer and more comfortable, and leaving
their parents to struggle on with the youngsters.&nbsp; It is a
selfish and ungrateful course, and therefore sure to be without a
blessing from God.&nbsp; I am talking now of those whose work
keeps them near home, and who only leave their home to escape its
duties, or as they would miscall them, its burdens.&nbsp; Many,
of course, must leave home.&nbsp; If work calls you elsewhere it
is another matter.&nbsp; It would be a very good thing in many
instances if young fellows would have the pluck to emigrate and
make their way in a new country.&nbsp; Englishmen are getting too
fond of stopping at home where the labour markets are
overstocked.&nbsp; Emigration is one of the best openings for a
young fellow if he makes up his mind to work, and does not expect
a fortune to fall into his lap because he has gone to a new
country to seek it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>SELF-IMPROVEMENT.</h2>
<p>Boys generally leave school at about thirteen years of age,
but they make a very great mistake if they leave off learning at
that age.&nbsp; Time might be roughly divided off into four
parts&mdash;necessary work, work for others, self-improvement,
and recreation.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s education is never
completed.&nbsp; A man is never too old to learn.&nbsp; Whilst
you are a boy and lad you need to be taught; afterwards you can
to a great extent learn for yourself.&nbsp; You should never be
content to remain just where you are, you should endeavour to
make the most of your opportunities, and to advance in knowledge
and capability.&nbsp; You are taught in your catechism to
&ldquo;do your duty in that state of life unto which it shall
please God to call you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This does not mean that you
are not to try and better your position.&nbsp; Quite the
contrary; it means that while you are to go on contentedly in the
station and work which God has allotted to you, you are also to
try and use to the utmost all the opportunities and powers which
he has given.&nbsp; He has called you to your present position,
He may <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>be calling you to something
more.&nbsp; If he has given you the power and opportunity of
raising yourself, he meant you to use them.&nbsp; It is a false
humility and a false view of religion that encourages sloth under
the pretence of being contented with one&rsquo;s humble
lot.&nbsp; There is God&rsquo;s work&mdash;real every day work to
be done in worldly as well as in what seems to be more directly
spiritual work.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s whole interest is not to be
centred on earthly things, neither are we to be so heavenly
minded as to neglect earthly duties, and the talents which God
has committed to our trust.&nbsp; It is your duty then to do your
utmost to improve your stock of knowledge.&nbsp; School has laid
the foundation, and you must work at the building.&nbsp; Your own
particular tastes or your work will suggest the subjects to which
you should first turn your attention.&nbsp; Develop the natural
powers you have, and advance steadily from one subject to
another.&nbsp; Set apart a certain portion of your spare time for
study and self-improvement.&nbsp; Remember also that you have
certain duties to your neighbours and your country, and that in
order to fulfil them you must understand your position as a man
and a citizen.&nbsp; Read the history both of your own country
and of <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>other lands.&nbsp; Read your
paper.&nbsp; Study the questions of the day, both at home and
abroad, and learn to form your own opinion concerning them.&nbsp;
Learn to think for yourself, and not take as gospel all that you
read in your favourite paper.&nbsp; Look at both sides of a
question and make up your own mind.&nbsp; Comparatively few
people think for themselves, and for that reason men are so often
carried away by popular leaders, and obstinately follow opinions,
the truth of which they have never tested, and the consequences
of which they have never considered.&nbsp; There are many
opportunities in classes and lectures for men to gain
information, but they will be of little real use unless men will
think for themselves, and work out the subjects instead of taking
their opinions ready made.&nbsp; Study, not simply listen.&nbsp;
Study both secular and religious subjects.&nbsp; You may be sure
that there can be no advance in real self-improvement unless it
is well balanced.&nbsp; Religious knowledge should go hand in
hand with secular knowledge.&nbsp; Christ should be our great
example in this as in all else, and He &ldquo;increased in wisdom
and stature, and in favour with God and men.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>CHUMS.</h2>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together.&nbsp; A man is known by his
friends.&nbsp; It is of great importance therefore that your
friends should be such as will show that you yourself are of the
right sort.&nbsp; A boy, unless he is a particularly disagreeable
one, will probably have a fair number of friends, that is to say,
of fellows that he knows and associates with, but above and
beyond these he will probably have some one particular chum, one
who shares in all his plans, one with whom to talk over all his
schemes, one often with whom to join in some piece of
mischief.&nbsp; Chums to do one another much good should be about
the same age.&nbsp; There may be a friendship between an elder
and a younger boy, or between a boy and a man, but they will not
be exactly chums.&nbsp; A friendship of this sort is very useful
if the elder is one who will lead aright, but if the elder is the
weaker of the two, or still more if the elder is viciously
inclined, such an acquaintance is one of the worst possible
things for a lad.&nbsp; A young boy, hanging on to an elder one,
<!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>learning all his bad habits, is only too likely to prove
an apt pupil, and come utterly to grief.&nbsp; Remember no one is
worthy of the name of friend who would ever counsel you to do
anything wrong, or who would not give you a word in season when
he found you were going on a wrong tack.&nbsp; A chum of
one&rsquo;s own age is quite a different article.&nbsp; Very
often they are not lads of the same dispositions and tastes, and
are drawn to one another by these very differences.&nbsp; It not
unfrequently happens that a bright active lad will chum with a
very quiet meditative one.&nbsp; The one doing the thinking and
the other the acting.&nbsp; Such friendships will last on
sometimes through life, but generally well through boyhood.&nbsp;
Very often the last act of chumship is the acting as best man at
the friend&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; Such friendships will work
great good so long as they are on the give and take principle,
and that nothing is given or taken of the bad qualities which may
be in each.&nbsp; A boy without a chum is very likely to grow
either conceited or selfish, or both.&nbsp; A good-natured chum
is a very useful check.&nbsp; He does not mind chaffing him out
of any little absurdities, and rubbing against one another they
manage to knock off many odd corners and polish <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>up one
another.&nbsp; Any chumship in evil is to be avoided.&nbsp; If a
chum, however much he may be liked, wants you to go in for a
partnership in evil he must be given up.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say
that you can give up caring for him, but he must be made to see
clearly that he must make his choice between the evil doing and
you&mdash;that he cannot be chums with both.&nbsp; Chums should
have strict honour between themselves, and always be ready to
stand up for one another.&nbsp; A good chum prevents one becoming
a prig, and there is nothing short of actual vice which is so
hateful in a boy as priggishness.&nbsp; There is as much
difference between a prig and a right-minded boy as between chalk
and cheese.&nbsp; A right-minded boy goes on his way trying to do
right and live honestly and purely, because it is right and
honourable, and because deep in his own heart he knows he has
promised Jesus Christ that he will live a godly life.&nbsp; A
prig is also doing right and living purely and honestly, but is
all the time trying to make other people see it, and not doing it
simply because it is right.&nbsp; Hence he has not half the
strength when real temptation comes, because he has always been
looking at the outside effect of his life, instead of <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>looking inward, to see if he is true to his
promise.&nbsp; Avoid priggishness, but do not be afraid of being
called a prig when it is only the taunt by which someone hopes to
shame you into doing that which you know in your heart is
wrong.</p>
<h2><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>COURTSHIP.</h2>
<p>There comes a time when a young man begins seriously to look
forward to settling in life and having a home of his own.&nbsp;
As a boy he may have had his likings among the girl companions
with whom he was acquainted, but now it becomes a totally
different question, and his intercourse with young women assumes
the position of courtship.</p>
<p>It is only natural and right that man should look where God
intended him to look for a help-meet and companion, but all
depends upon the way in which he does it.&nbsp; There is no need
to be in a hurry.&nbsp; Better to wait and make quite sure.&nbsp;
As a general rule I should say that twenty-five was quite young
enough for a man to marry, but still that must entirely depend
upon circumstances.</p>
<p>Before I venture to suggest a few thoughts concerning
courtship and the choice of a wife, I should like to make a few
remarks upon the manner in which women ought to be treated by
men.&nbsp; It is too much the custom for men to look upon women
as beings the object of whose creation was to be <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>pleasant companions for them before marriage and useful
servants after marriage.&nbsp; Hence there is a very great want
of respect and honourable treatment.&nbsp; A young fellow, before
he steadies down as the expression is, does not think there is
anything mean or dishonourable in his leading a girl on, and
without any intention of ruining her, allowing her to lower
herself by her conversation and manners.&nbsp; He does not
consider the harm that he is doing to the girl, how it may be the
first step to ruin.&nbsp; He means no harm, only just amusing
himself with her.&nbsp; Is it not mean, however, simply for his
own pleasure to treat a woman as if she were merely a plaything,
instead of a being as valuable in God&rsquo;s sight as himself,
and equally with him an object of God&rsquo;s love and
care.&nbsp; No words suffice to denounce the wickedness and
meanness of the coward, who, taking advantage of a girl&rsquo;s
real though misguided love for him, will seduce her into sin and
then leave her to bear the punishment and disgrace.&nbsp; No
words can describe the heartless wickedness which will rob a
woman of that which is her greatest treasure and ornament, and
bring upon her a sorrow which the grave alone can end.&nbsp; He
may escape punishment here.&nbsp; He may even gain a <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>sort
of reputation as one who can always gain the attention of women,
but he will only receive the greater punishment from the judge
and avenger of all.&nbsp; One word more before I close these
remarks, which I would have gladly omitted from these papers, but
truth demands them.</p>
<p>Some men seem to think that the sin and responsibility is very
slight if it be committed with a woman who trades upon her
sin.&nbsp; Undoubtedly it is not so cowardly as the ruin of a
pure and innocent woman, but who can tell that you may not have
met with that woman at the turning point in her life, when but
for you she might have repented? and at the very least you have
added to the weight of her sin.&nbsp; Once she had been pure, God
alone knows her history, but who of the many who have taken
advantage of her misery and helped to chain her to her life of
sin will be held guiltless by Him?&nbsp; Great, fearful is her
guilt, but God alone knows how she may long to be free.&nbsp; Far
greater is their guilt who for their own selfish enjoyment do not
hesitate to plunge deeper into ruin a soul for whom Christ
died.&nbsp; If men treated all women honourably&mdash;all, not
simply their relations and friends,&mdash;there would not be
those who make their <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>living by sin.&nbsp; Such a state of
things it may be hopeless to expect, so long as cowards are to be
found amongst men, but it is not too much to expect from
honourable men and Christians that they should treat all women
with such respect, that, as far as lies in their power, the
stigma of meanness and cowardice should not rest upon the men of
this land.&nbsp; Treat them with respect, not only in your
intercourse with them, but in your conversation about them, and
your thoughts concerning them.</p>
<p>But to turn to a pleasanter subject, the honourable courtship
of man and maiden.&nbsp; Certain things should be taken into
consideration in making your choice.&nbsp; First, that the object
of your choice should be one whom you can thoroughly love and
entirely trust.&nbsp; Secondly, that she should be one whom you
feel would be a real help in life.&nbsp; Thirdly, that she should
be of the same religion as yourself (otherwise difficulties in
after life are sure to arise) and a really religious woman.&nbsp;
And Fourthly, that she should be not merely, or even necessarily,
a bright and pretty companion, but should have such qualities as
are necessary for a good wife and mother&mdash;one who can manage
a home as well as help to pass an hour or so pleasantly.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Your courtship should be thoroughly open and
above-board.&nbsp; The parents consent should first be obtained,
and remember that you are bound to respect their wishes.&nbsp; Be
careful also that she shall never in any way be compromised by
your conduct.&nbsp; I say no more because I have assumed at the
beginning that your courtship is honourable, that you love the
girl of your choice, and that as you would shield her from all
injury from others, so she will be safe under your
protection.&nbsp; Take no ordinary standard as the rule of your
courtship, but determine from the very beginning that it shall be
so conducted, that when as man and wife you look back upon it, it
may be with feelings free from any taint of sorrow or shame; that
when you stand before God to be married it may be as honest man
and maiden, seeking for God&rsquo;s full blessing upon your
married life, as it has rested upon your unmarried days.&nbsp;
One thing I would say in conclusion, and I mention it last as
being the most important, let your choice of a wife be a subject
of earnest prayer to God, and when your choice has been made, and
your love pledged one to another, let it be a subject of mutual
prayer that each may help the other to live to the glory of God,
in the station of life in which he sees fit to place you.</p>
<h2><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>HUSBANDS.</h2>
<p>The headship of a family carries with it heavy
responsibilities.&nbsp; We may shrink from them and avoid them,
but still they remain.&nbsp; A good husband and a good father
makes a happy home and honest children.&nbsp; Drunkenness is too
often the destruction of home.&nbsp; If the head of the family
can rule himself in this as in other matters then he may
reasonably hope for a happy and comfortable home, but if drink is
allowed to take the place of wife or children, drink will rule
the household and swallow up its peace and prosperity.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, drunkenness is not by any means the only fault or
indeed the beginning of the break up of a home.&nbsp; It is very
often the result of a home made miserable by other and easily
avoided faults.&nbsp; Many I suppose start their married life
with the full intention of realising their ideas of a happy
home.&nbsp; The picture is very pleasant, the reality is too
often quite the reverse.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Very often because of a
want of mutual forbearance.&nbsp; It takes some little time
really to know one another, and unless there is a spirit of <!--
page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>mutual forbearance the little differences will become
great quarrels.&nbsp; The husband is to rule, but he is not to be
a tyrant.&nbsp; The wife is not bound to give a blind obedience
to all his commands, and the husband is bound to respect his
wife&rsquo;s wishes.&nbsp; It ought to be a rule that in matters
of importance, where either feels it to be a question of duty,
that if they cannot agree neither should endeavour to force the
other to act against their conscience.</p>
<p>My first piece of practical advice to husbands would be to
have a proper understanding about money matters, and to be
liberal therein.&nbsp; Give your wife a regular sum per week, and
let it be clearly arranged what expenses she is responsible
for.</p>
<p>Secondly, do not have any friends that you cannot or do not
care to bring to your home, and let no one come between you and
your wife, or draw you away to enjoy yourself apart from her.</p>
<p>Thirdly, do your church-going together as far as you can, and
when that is impossible arrange one with the other, so that each
may be able to go at some time every Sunday.&nbsp; Above all keep
one another up to your regular Communions, for there is little
blessing on the married union that is not blessed with a higher
communion.</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Fourthly.&nbsp; When you have children train them
yourself, specially the boys, who will gain far more good from
father than from anyone else.&nbsp; It is too much the custom to
leave all the religious training to mother or to school.&nbsp;
Take your children to Church with you instead of seeing that they
are sent.&nbsp; Come is a much better word of instruction than
go.</p>
<p>A few words in conclusion as to the general duties of a man,
be he married or single.&nbsp; You have no right to shirk your
duties as a man to your home, as a Christian to your Church, or
as a citizen to your country.&nbsp; The support and training of
your family is your first duty, and nothing may rightly come in
the way of that, but the fulfilling of that need not prevent your
carrying out your other duties.&nbsp; You are a Christian, you
receive spiritual benefits from your connection with the Church,
you are bound then to make some return.&nbsp; Your prayers, your

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
